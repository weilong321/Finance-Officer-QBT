# Finance-Officer-QBT-Tasks
Below is a list of projects/scripts I have created for QBT as a Finance Officer. More details about the projects can be found in their respective folders' readme file.

## *Automating weekly reconciliation of supplier payments*
### Results and Achievements
Before automation, when other people and I were doing the reconciliation process manually, it took a person one day to process and investigate one weeks worth of statements. After writing and running the script, it took one hour to process the datasets, create a coversheet and investigate the exceptional items for each week. This was almost an increase of 8x in efficiency for this task. 
### Coding language and libraries used:
- Python:
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Openpyxl
    - os

## *Subledger*
### Results and Achievements
Before automation, it took a person one week to process and correct/investigate each general ledger's subledgers. With the script I have written, each general ledger and its subledgers could be analyzed and corrected in less than 30 minutes. This is an incredible increase in efficiency, allowing for up-to-date book keeping as opposed to late submissions due to manual work.
### Coding language and libraries used:
- Python:
    - Selenium
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Openpyxl
    - os
    - shutil
